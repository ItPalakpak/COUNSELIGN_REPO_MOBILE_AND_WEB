# Flutter Project Structure (Counselign)

Entrypoint & Navigation
- `lib/main.dart`: app bootstrap, providers, theme
- `lib/routes.dart`: route table / generator and navigation helpers

Feature Modules (examples)
- `lib/landingscreen/`: landing flow, dialogs, state
- `lib/studentscreen/`: student features, models, screens, state
- `lib/counselorscreen/`: counselor features
- `lib/adminscreen/`: admin features
- Each feature may contain `models/`, `state/`, `widgets/` and root `*_screen.dart`

Shared Layers
- `lib/api/`: API clients, config, interceptors
- `lib/utils/`: helpers, formatters, constants
- `lib/widgets/`: shared reusable widgets

Conventions
- Keep models immutable with `fromJson`/`toJson`
- Keep network calls in `lib/api/` and orchestrate via view models in `state/`
- Keep screens lean; move logic to state/services
- Register routes centrally in `lib/routes.dart`

Quality Gates
- Run `flutter analyze` before commits; keep analyzer warnings at 0
- Add/maintain tests in `test/` for state/models/widgets
