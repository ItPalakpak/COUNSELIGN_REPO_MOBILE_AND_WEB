# Progress

## What works
- App boots with Material theme and named routes.

## Done (Dec 19, 2024) - Counselor Schedule Display Feature Implementation & Enhancement
- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Implemented and enhanced counselor schedule display feature in Flutter student appointment pages with calendar drawer integration:

  - **Model Creation**: Created `CounselorSchedule` model (`lib/studentscreen/models/counselor_schedule.dart`) with proper JSON parsing for counselor schedule data including counselor ID, name, degree, and time slots
  - **UI Enhancement**: Enhanced calendar drawers in both `schedule_appointment_screen.dart` and `my_appointments_screen.dart` to display counselor schedules organized by weekday (Monday-Friday only)

## Done (Dec 19, 2024) - Student Pending Appointment Button Layout and Loading States Enhancement
- **LAYOUT FIX**: Fixed RenderFlex overflow error of 21 pixels in pending appointment action buttons row:
  - **Root Cause**: Row widget containing action buttons was overflowing on smaller screens due to insufficient space constraints
  - **Overflow Error**: "RenderFlex overflowed by 21 pixels on the right" in pending appointment form action buttons
  - **Solution**: Implemented responsive LayoutBuilder with conditional layout based on screen size and available width
  - **Edit Mode Priority**: "Save Changes" and "Cancel Edit" buttons always stay in one row regardless of screen size to maintain UX consistency
  - **Non-Edit Mode Priority**: "Enable Edit" and "Cancel" buttons always stay in one row regardless of screen size to maintain UX consistency
  - **Button Constraints**: Wrapped all buttons in Flexible widgets with flex: 1 for equal space distribution in both edit and non-edit modes
  - **Button Sizing**: Added consistent padding (horizontal: 12, vertical: 8) for better button proportions
  - **Loading States**: Added comprehensive loading states to Update button and Confirm Cancellation button with proper state management
  - **Update Button Loading**: Shows circular progress indicator and "Updating..." text during appointment update process
  - **Cancel Button Loading**: Shows circular progress indicator and "Cancelling..." text during appointment cancellation process
  - **Automatic Modal Closure**: Cancellation dialog automatically closes after successful cancellation process
  - **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with loading state cleanup in finally blocks
  - **Context Safety**: Added proper context.mounted checks for all UI interactions after async operations
  - **Type Safety**: Follows Flutter best practices with proper layout management, loading states, and responsive design patterns
  - **No Linter Errors**: Successfully tested with flutter analyze showing no issues
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `lib/studentscreen/my_appointments_screen.dart` - Fixed action buttons layout with responsive design, loading states, and automatic modal closure
    - `lib/studentscreen/state/my_appointments_viewmodel.dart` - Added setUpdatingAppointment and setCancellingAppointment methods for loading state management

## Done (Dec 19, 2024) - Critical Fix: Cancellation Dialog Crash
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed app crash when clicking Cancel button in pending appointment card:
  - **Root Cause**: Consumer<MyAppointmentsViewModel> in dialog was causing crash because dialog context doesn't have access to the Provider
  - **Error**: "Lost connection to device" - app crashed when opening cancellation dialog
  - **Solution**: Removed Consumer widget and used direct _viewModel reference from parent widget state
  - **StatefulBuilder**: Wrapped dialog in StatefulBuilder to enable reactive UI updates for loading states
  - **setState Calls**: Added setState(() {}) calls after loading state changes to trigger dialog rebuilds
  - **Loading State Management**: Maintained proper loading state with _viewModel.setCancellingAppointment()
  - **Context Safety**: All context.mounted checks preserved for safe UI operations
  - **Type Safety**: Follows Flutter best practices with proper state management patterns
  - **No Linter Errors**: Successfully tested with flutter analyze showing no issues
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `lib/studentscreen/my_appointments_screen.dart` - Fixed cancellation dialog crash by removing Consumer and using StatefulBuilder

## Pending Follow-ups
- Periodic scan for new deprecations after package upgrades.
- Consider central utility for toast/snackbar to standardize UI messages.
